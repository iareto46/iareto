                       <p class='biotitle'><b>Chapter 1: The Islands</b></p>
                            <p>I was born in Kahuku, Hawaii on the north shore of Oahu. My dad is Frederick “Jay” Reid and Clois Valencia. My full name is Jared Amadeo Reid, Jared is from my dad’s brother and my middle name is from my great grandfather on my mom’s side. My only memories of Hawaii were being right next to BYU Hawaii and having a weird reddish tinted carpet. When I was about 3 years old we moved to the island of American Samoa where my dad is from. We lived with my grandparents and their live-in nanny who my younger brother and I spent most of our time with. Her name was Moala and she probably wouldn't admit this but my brother was definitely her favorite. We spent most of our time with kids nearby running around outside and climbing up trees getting all dirty. There were so many stray dogs that we would keep one and name him Lasco and when he ran away we just got a new one and named him the same thing. My grandparents owned a couple of small businesses nearby which we would hang out at when we were not in school. They owned a laundromat, convenient store and a restaurant called milovales. I attended a small charter school where we had to wear a uniform. Whenever you would get in trouble you would get slapped or your ear pulled. Looking back, living in Samoa was pretty rough but one important lesson I learned was discipline and appreciation for the things I have. I also learned how to enjoy the small things.</p>
                        <p class='biotitle'><b>Chapter 2: The Desert</b></p>
                            <p>My time on the island life was short lived as my mom being from california absolutely hated living in Samoa and found a job on the islands. It took a few months for my dad to get transferred there so My brother and I went with her. We lived in a small apartment in a suburb of Phoenix. A few months later my dad joined us. I have always been a loud and outgoing person who loved to talk to people. However, I had a hard time making friends or feeling like I fit in with kids in elementary and middle school. I wasn’t shy but I always felt I was being annoying and I often compromised my own personality to try and fit in which lead me to be mean to the people who were actually my friends. When I was 10 my mom gave birth to my little sister.  During this time my family was not really going to church. We were visited often by members of our ward and missionaries. In an effort to get us involved, I started attending boy scouts where I met friends in my ward. It dawned on me when I was 10 years old that all my friends were baptized and I wasn’t. After meetings with the missionaries my brother and I were baptized the same day by my dad. This isn’t an amazing conversion story, I only wanted to be baptized because I am the only one in my class who hasn’t. However, this was the start of our actual conversion as a family. 
                            Despite being baptized I never really became active until I was a deacon in the church and even then I only went because I had responsibilities. Middle school was really hard for me. I did very well in school but I had a really hard time fitting in and making friends. It is the only time in my life that I felt like I was bullied. Perhaps this is just part of the journey of middle school because honestly I haven’t met anyone who actually liked it. One silver lining in all of it though was that I actually tried to get involved in the church. My eighth grade year I became very intrigued by return missionaries and their stories. Being the oldest I never really had anyone to look up to so these return missionaries were like heroes to me. Although it never made me want to serve a mission I admired their attitudes towards everything.</p>
                        <p class='biotitle'><b>Chapter 3:The Thunder</b></p>
                            <p>I attended Desert Vista High School home of the Thunder. High School was better than middle school but it still was not my favorite experience. I played football and it was a year round job. When we weren’t in season we were always having workouts and practices. I loved football but as high school dragged on I lost my love for it. Most of this was due to the culture of the team and how the leaders were very cruel to people and we weren’t even that good. I quit football after my junior year of high school and played rugby instead. I loved the sport but there was nowhere I could have gone with it so I just played one year of that. I am grateful for football though, it taught me how to work hard and how to push myself. 
                            High school also brought some firsts, first girlfriend, first car, first job. I developed a lot of insecurities once dating came into the picture. My first girlfriend caused a lot of tension between my close friends and I. I learned a lot about maturity and perspective from dating in high school although I would not go back to that mindset.</p>
                        <p class='biotitle'><b>Chapter 4:The Shift</b></p>
                            <p>The big turning point of my life came right before my senior year of high school. I attended this program at Brigham Young University called SOAR which is a week long summer camp for Multicultural students trying to apply for college. The best advice I received upon arriving was “this is the opportunity to be the person you have always wanted to be” I took that to heart and that was when everything changed. Like I said I was always loud and talkative but this week I felt like I was doing it in a good way. I met so many friends and became confident in talking to girls. We were in a meeting one time and one of the counselors asked what we wanted out this week and I blurted out thinking I was funny “bonds that would last a lifetime”. Little did I know that is exactly what I would have gotten. Perhaps the biggest takeaway from SOAR was that I have it to be the biggest reason I decided to serve a mission for the church. I was inspired by the kids my age so dedicated to serving and I realized that I have never been that dedicated to anything and I wanted to feel what they felt.</p>
                        <p class='biotitle'><b>Chapter 5:The Mission</b></p>
                            <p>I served in the Idaho Nampa Mission from August 2016 to 2018. I could have sworn I was going to go foreign. Idaho isn’t the prettiest place and I could go on and on about how I loved it anyways and how great the people were. I could write a whole other paper about the people I taught and how they affected me. But the greatest lessons I learned actually came from my companions. You know I always prided myself on being able to get along with people but some of my many companions really tested me. But looking back I loved every single one. My biggest takeaway and the most applicable lesson was that you can get along with anyone but you gotta let go of your own pride in order to expect any change from the other person. I will tell any missionary that my advice would be to make it work with their companions first and foremost then the miracles will come.</p>
                        <p class='biotitle'><b>Chapter 6:The Y</b></p> 
                            <p>All this leads me to now, here at BYU. I moved in with one of my friends from SOAR and a bunch of kids from his mission. My self discovery has taken many years. I have been trying for so long to figure out how to combine all the lessons I have learned about myself. My time here at BYU has been the glue that I have been looking for. I pushed myself to date more, and failed a lot at that. I tried to take chances on starting businesses and youtube channels and ultimately failed at those too. I met a lot of people and tried running with crowds I really didn’t fit in with. Despite all these failures in college I can confidently say that I am the best version of myself right now and I hope to be even better in the years to come. 
                            As I write this biography of myself I am currently applying to BYU’s Business school to study Experience Design and Management. I work for the football team as a recruiting assistant and my love for the sport has returned. My dream is to be the head of recruiting one day and be able to help kids develop their passion for this sport. I have a girlfriend and she has been amazing. I am closer to my family and the gospel. I can’t say that I made it but I feel like I have overcome a huge mountain in my life and that is my self confidence.</p>
